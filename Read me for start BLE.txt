4. Start Advertising BLE
The next step is to start advertising in order to be detected by other 
devices. To make the steps easier, I’ll use hciconfig command.
and there is a secend method to do that with dbus interface 
so for the first method 
in terminal type this fto start advertising  :
	
sudo hciconfig hci0 leadv 0

Type below to stop the advertisement :

sudo hciconfig hci0 noleadv
